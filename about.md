Hi, I am Mandar, currently working at the Multi Scale Dynamics group at [CWI Amsterdam](http://www.cwi.nl/) as a PhD researcher. Before getting my M.S. in A.I. at the [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/), I completed a dual degree bachelors and masters in manufacturing science from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).

I created [DynaML](http://mandar2812.github.io/DynaML/), a Scala based open-source library for large (and small) scale machine learning. My interests include applied Mathematics in the areas of machine learning, statistical inference, physical systems, computer science etc.
